               <p> rose Tattoo was released on 2013 
                   among the album Signed and Sealed in Blood.
                   For founder, bassist and singer Ken Casey, these songs aim "to tell you a life story in four minutes.
                   The  single "Rose Tattoo" was inspired by Casey's own tattoos.
                    "Throughout life — trials, tribulations, dates, times, places, things that are important to you, family, 
                    people who have passed away — tattoos on my body document my life and what I've been through, 
                    things that have been important to me," Casey tells NPR's Audie Cornish. "You know, they're all a part of the story."


                    "He taught me most things that make me who I am today,
                    " Casey says. 
                    "He was a big union guy in Boston. 
                    It's in a visible place for me, and I look down and I see it a lot. 
                    He was such an inspiring man that it inspires me. 
                    Oftentimes, I just catch it out of the corner of my eye and it literally changes my mood when I think of him and what a strong individual he was."

               Roses are a complex flower, and a popular tattoo. The beauty of this flower expresses promise, hope, and new beginnings. ... It is contrasted by thorns symbolizing defense, loss, and thoughtlessness. 
               A yellow rose symbolizes joy, protection against envious lovers, and a mature love.
              </p>
                
          <p> You'll always be there with me
            Even if you're gone
            You'll always have my love
            Our memory will live on...</p>
